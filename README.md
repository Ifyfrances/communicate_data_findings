This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. It is the last part of the Data VIsualisation module. Data Visualisation is an important skill and applied in many parts of data analysis processes.
The aim is to highlight my skills and also develop more skills by application of the concepts learned in this course.

 In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries like Pandas to systematically explore the selected dataset which in this case is the "Ford bike sharing dataset". I manually and programmatically explored the dataset, creating univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots to better understand the dataset and communicate findings in a understandable format to users.
 
 In the second part, I created a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that was discovered. 
 
 ABOUT DATASET

 For this project I choose to analyse and plot visualisations for the Ford go bike dataset for 2018. This dataset was provided by Udacity and downloaded manually from the resource centre as a .CSV file. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering in the greater San Francisco Bay area.

It contains 183412 trips and 16 features.

duration_sec| start_time|end_time|start_station_id| start_station_name|start_station_latitude|start_station_longitude |end_station_id|end_station_name|end_station_latitude|end_station_longitude|bike_id|user_type|member_birth_year|member_gender.

I commenced by carrying out Data Wrangling processes on the data to ensure it meets the requirements for Quality and Tidy Data. Issues were highlighted and cleaning was done to ensure the data meets the quality and tidiness requirements.

In the second phase "Explanatory Phase" Various plots from "Univaraite to Multivariate" were created to give and share the insights observed in the first phase.

CONCLUSION

In summary, my findings are as follows:
From the collected and analysed data, there are more male riders compared to female, the data covers for one month "February in 2018" hence not enough to conclude that the ratio of male to female riders is greater for male.

The mean age for Females who are subscribers (Paid for annual subscription) is 32 and 31 for non-subscribers. Even though there are older riders captured by this dataset, most of them are male.

The distance travelled didn't show much difference between the male and female gender.

A lot of anomalies captured in the data as their are riders with age upto "140years". It is possible that they do not wish to share their real age or it is an error in the data capture process.

The age distribution shows that most of the riders are male and that the avaerage mean age is 33.

There is a positive correlation between the distance travelled and duration, a pointer that as disctance increases the duration also increases.

The top 10 take off stations are located within business areas. And close to the train stations.
